### Installation

Sadly, moody is still under development since there are alot of bugs and features yet to be finished.

### Inspiration

I got this idea of creating my own tiling windows manager in a dream. After I woke up, I decided to create moody since I had no projects to work on.
moody is inspired by dwm's minimalism and i3's simplicity

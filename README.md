# MoodyWM

## Overview

Moody is a minimalistic tiling windows manager written in C. Moody's goal is to be blazingly fast, very minimal but still easy for new users to pick it up.

**Note**: Moody is just a side project to learn about C and tiling windows managers and is created to solve some problems I have with other windows manager.

### Installation

### Inspiration

I got this idea of creating my own tiling windows manager in a dream. After I woke up, I decided to create moody since I had no projects to work on.
moody is inspired by dwm's minimalism and i3's simplicity
